# GC vs AT DNA Classifier using Machine Learning

This project uses a logistic regression model to classify DNA sequences based on their nucleotide composition — specifically GC and AT content. It demonstrates a basic bioinformatics workflow using synthetic data, making it ideal for students new to ML in biology.

## Objectives
- Generate random DNA sequences
- Compute GC and AT content
- Train an ML classifier to categorize sequences as GC-rich or AT-rich
- Visualize data distribution using histograms

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Results
Achieved 100% accuracy using logistic regression. Visualized data distribution with clear GC vs AT separation.


## Future Improvements
- Add k-mer frequency features
- Use real DNA sequences (e.g., from NCBI or Ensembl)
- Experiment with more complex models (Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- Apply model to real-world genome classification tasks
